# React-Site
First React website to practice my development skills on. Uses Axios for CRUD, NodeJS and Express for server/client communications, and ReactJS as its UI library. Things I'd like to get clear on creating this single-page app:

- Structuring a website and its underlying database in a highly efficient, secure way
- Streaming media data on the application, being able to interact with and create new data on the page without disrupting the UI.
- Getting a better general sense of Frontend design, including frameworks, animations, and best practices for making a site a simply a joy to use
